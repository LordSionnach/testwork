			<p class="flavor">
				Born of the pages of books and the meddling of wizards, the scriptorii are a people created by love of lore and magical arrogance. Scriptorii are living tomes, held together by arcane forces. Originally invented by wizards to serve them in their magical practice, scriptorii have spread beyond the towers of mages into the world below. Their fi erce intellect often carries with it an intense curiosity, and wherever there is a whisper of lost lore or a secret to be uncovered, one might fi nd a scriptorii in search of it.

			<h4>
				PAPER PEOPLE
			</h4>
				<p>
					Scriptorii are the spirits of books, with no internal mass. Rather, they appear to be a hollow space surrounded by pages pressed against invisible body. They range from under fi ve feet to over six feet tall, but only weigh about 20-50 pounds. Scriptorii can have any build, but most incline towards a slender form. Being made of paper, they are usually the colors of parchment, though some, drawn from unusual texts, might be the color of dark brown leather or even the green of leaves. Some Scriptorii dress themselves in heavy robes, wrappings, and hoods, to avoid unwanted attention when moving through the world, but others are proud of their arcane nature and adorn themselves only with a small belt or satchel for practical needs.
				</p>	
			<h4>
				BOUND SPIRITS, UNBOUND MINDS
			</h4>
				<p>
					The scriptorii were originally designed by wizards to prove the idea that souls were not divine in origin, but arcane. Whether the existence of the Paper People truly proves this is still a matter of debate, but nevertheless, the scriptorii walk the earth and seem to think and feel and dream. Most scriptorii are spirit-bound from existing books by wizards for a purpose, often acting as assistants in diffi cult spellwork, taking the place of laborious memorization. But accidents happen to ambitious wizards all the time, and some scriptorii walk free.
