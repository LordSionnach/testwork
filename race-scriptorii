			<p class="flavor">
				Born of the pages of books and the meddling of wizards, the scriptorii are a people created by love of lore and magical arrogance. Scriptorii are living tomes, held together by arcane forces. Originally invented by wizards to serve them in their magical practice, scriptorii have spread beyond the towers of mages into the world below. Their fi erce intellect often carries with it an intense curiosity, and wherever there is a whisper of lost lore or a secret to be uncovered, one might fi nd a scriptorii in search of it.
			</p>
			<h4>
				PAPER PEOPLE
			</h4>
				<p>
					Scriptorii are the spirits of books, with no internal mass. Rather, they appear to be a hollow space surrounded by pages pressed against invisible body. They range from under fi ve feet to over six feet tall, but only weigh about 20-50 pounds. Scriptorii can have any build, but most incline towards a slender form. Being made of paper, they are usually the colors of parchment, though some, drawn from unusual texts, might be the color of dark brown leather or even the green of leaves. Some Scriptorii dress themselves in heavy robes, wrappings, and hoods, to avoid unwanted attention when moving through the world, but others are proud of their arcane nature and adorn themselves only with a small belt or satchel for practical needs.
				</p>	
			<h4>
				BOUND SPIRITS, UNBOUND MINDS
			</h4>
				<p>
					The scriptorii were originally designed by wizards to prove the idea that souls were not divine in origin, but arcane. Whether the existence of the Paper People truly proves this is still a matter of debate, but nevertheless, the scriptorii walk the earth and seem to think and feel and dream. Most scriptorii are spirit-bound from existing books by wizards for a purpose, often acting as assistants in diffi cult spellwork, taking the place of laborious memorization. But accidents happen to ambitious wizards all the time, and some scriptorii walk free.

				Scriptorii Names

				<p>Most scriptorii keep the titles of their original books, with more familiar nicknames for everyday use.</p>

					<span class="emphasis">
						Scriptorii Names<br />

					<span class="emphasis">Titles: </span>Framington’s Guide to Agriculture, Myths and Legends of the Far Realms, The Art and Science of Siege Warfare, Halflings: A History, Anatomy for Beginners, Viktor’s Arsenal of Barbed Witticisms <br />

			<h4>
				SCRIPTORII TRAITS
			</h4>
				<p>
					Your scriptorii character has a number of qualities in common with other scriptorii.
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="feature">Ability Score Increase. </span>Your Intelligence score increases by 2.<br />
					<span class="feature">Age. </span>Scriptorii count their ages both by their original publication date and by when they were spirit-bound. So a Scriptorii might say that they are “sixty and four,” meaning their original book was published 60 years ago, and they were bound 4 years ago.<br />
					<span class="feature">Alignment. </span>Scriptorii can be any alignment, depending on their core volume.<br />
					<span class="feature">Size. </span>Scriptorii average about 5 feet tall, but only weigh between 25–50 pounds, since they are made of paper held together by arcane force. Your size is Medium.<br />
					<span class="feature">Speed. </span>Your base walking speed is 30 feet.<br />
					<span class="feature">Flammable. </span> When you take fire damage, you must make a Dexterity saving throw. The DC equals 10 or half the damage you take, whichever number is higher. On a failure, you catch fire and take an extra 1d6 fire damage at the end of each of your turns as long as you are on fire. You can use your action to put out the fire. <br />
					<span class="feature">Languages. </span>You can speak, read, and write Common and two other languages of your choice.<br />
					<span class="feature">Paper Person. </span>As a spirit-bound book, you don’t eat, drink, or breathe. You also have resistance to poison damage and have advantage on saves against the poisoned condition. You do not sleep, but must periodically spend 4 hours checking over your pages, copying and repairing damaged passages. While doing so, you are conscious and alert, but focused, and have disadvantage to Perception checks to notice approaching danger. After repairing yourself, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep. Magic that would put a humanoid to sleep instead renders you paralyzed instead of unconscious for the effect’s normal duration.<br />
					<span class="feature">Made of Words. </span>Scriptorii don’t search out hidden knowledge from idle curiosity. Since you are formed of paper and magic, you can attune to a spell scroll as a magic item. When you attune to the scroll, it becomes part of your form and is consumed, and cannot be reused if you unattune to it. You may then cast the spell from that scroll once, regaining the ability to do so after you finish a long rest. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for this spell, and the DC of saving throws is 8 + your Intelligence modifier + your proficiency modifier. At 1st level you may attune to a spell scroll containing a cantrip. This benefit increases to a 1st level spell at 6th level, 2nd at 11th level, and 3rd at 16th level..<br />
					<span class="feature">Subrace. </span>You are the bound spirit of a book or library devoted to a certain topic. Choose between Volume of Discipline, Volume of Erudition, Volume of Philosophy, or Volume of Literature.<br />
